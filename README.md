Registering software environments in CK
=======================================

This is a stable repository used to register
environment of various software in CK to let multiple
versions of different easily co-exist, automatically
resolve dependencies during tool installation, and
support experimentation with various versions of
tools. For example, we use it for autotuning with
different versions of LLVM, GCC, ICC, etc.
