You can download and install latest (or required) OpenCL SDK here:

For Intel GPUs:
* https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-opencl

For Nvidia GPUs:
* https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads

For MALI-based GPUs:
* http://malideveloper.arm.com/resources/sdks/mali-opencl-sdk

NOTE that C++ headers are often not included by default.
You may hence need to manually download them here:
